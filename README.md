#Beer There & Back Again
Drink Good Beer Wherever Life Takes You

Created as my final project for General Assembly's Web Development Immersive course, this app allows users to search for local breweries by state or city. It also allows them to view the top 10 most voted beers for each state and to add their own votes to beers already in the top or beers that are not on the lists. The brewery and beer data is compiled from a third party API called BreweryDB.
